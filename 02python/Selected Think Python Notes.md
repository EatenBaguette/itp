# Think Python Selected Notes
## Chapter 1
### New
A program has these basic features:
- input: get data from keyboard, file, network
- output: display data on screen, save in a file, send over network
- math
- condition
- repetition
- Break down a complex problem until it can be solved by a combo of these steps.
### Knew
- Arithmetic Operators
    - + addition
    - - subtraction
    - * multiplication  
    - / division
    - // floor division
    - % remainder
    - ** exponentiation
## Chapter 3
### New
- when a function is called, python looks at the definition of the function (most likely in a different location in the code than what is currently running) to see what to do, then picks up where it left off.
### Knew
- math module (ie import math, math.sin(math.pi/6))
## Chapter 5
### New
- how to use recursion (self referencing a function) and a few use cases (changing the value of a variable after every loop to create a counter).
### Knew
- Boolean expressions, including relational operators (<, >, <=, >=). Except I didn't know !=.
## Chapter 10
### New
- I haven't used lists yet while learning python. 
```
for i in range(len(numbers)):
    numbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2
```
This is how to traverse a list and update items in it. This example multiplies each item of the list by 2.
### Knew
- Lists exist in python and they use square brackets to denote them.

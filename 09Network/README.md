## The process

First Eliott shared the link to the repository. We had trouble editing and realized Eliott had to add Ghibbi and me as collaborators so we could edit. Once that was figured out, it took a little while to figure out who was doing what.
We decided that Ghibbi would work on the music and some character quotes and descriptions. Eliott worked on the image and character quotes and descriptions.
I worked on the code.

While others were working on their tasks, I created the top part of the website. Eliott added the title and short description of the band. Then I added the section explaining the description with quotes. I used h4, then edited it in css. I then separated it with a horizontal line.

Then I used block quotes for the quotes. I asked Eliott and Ghibbi for quote ideas and went off of what they said.

I changed the code so that the quotes would display on the left and the image on the right. I used [this website](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7873833/how-do-i-make-a-div-tag-occupy-the-half-of-the-right-hand-side-of-my-web-page) as a reference. At first I was trying to make a class to put things on the right or left, but it was too complicated so I used this way.

I tried to add the logo on the top right using the same method but it didn't work. Ghibbi suggested putting the logo between the band name and the short description. That worked well.

After the quotes I added another horizontal line and used style width which I learned from tiling to the left and right to make it not interest the image.

Then I added the meet the band section. I created the structure for the section, including each division and heading containing the name of the band member and a paragraph section for the description. I wrote the description for Glacks. Elliott and Ghibbi filled in the rest of the information about the band members. 

Ghibbi implemented the audio file. I added it to a new division with a heading separating the section.

I was the main programmer. I outlined the main format/structure of the html document. I also updated the style sheet while programming the structure of HTML.

Eliott requested that we send an image of us. He used them to create a photoshopped image of the band. He also contributed to the story of the band. He helped with quotes and descriptions. They also updated the style sheet with fonts.

### Ghibbi
Ghibbi created the logo and music. They also implemented the music. They contributed to the story of the band by helping with quotes and writing descriptions of members.

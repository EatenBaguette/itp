# Documentation Guidelines
The documentation (again, always in Markdown as a .md file) must have the following:
- what you did
- how you did it
- the problems you faced (ABDYD: always be documenting your debugging!)
- how you overcame them
- what code you used from others/elsewhere
- where to find that code (specific links!!!)
- Other folks' GitHub public repositories and Stack OverFlow Links to an external site. are the best places to go for help most of the time
- Correctly document all your debugging, especially if you code ultimately does not run as intended. I will take points off for code that does not run correctly, but will still give partial credit if it is well-documented.
- For the purposes of this class, your documentation also helps you prepare to talk about your code in class with your colleagues.

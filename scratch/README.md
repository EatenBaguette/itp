#Scratch Documentation#

The documentation (again, always in Markdown as a .md file) must have the following:
- what you did
- how you did it
- the problems you faced (ABDYD: always be documenting your debugging!)
- how you overcame them
- what code you used from others/elsewhere
- where to find that code (specific links!!!)
- Other folks' GitHub public repositories and Stack OverFlow Links to an external site. are the best places to go for help most of the time
- Correctly document all your debugging, especially if you code ultimately does not run as intended. I will take points off for code that does not run correctly, but will still give partial credit if it is well-documented.
- For the purposes of this class, your documentation also helps you prepare to talk about your code in class with your colleagues.

collect berries, make sound if collect berries.
if go close to bear, drop berries?


##Implementation##
###Movement###
- I used [https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/959988092/editor](this) demo scratch assignment to figure out the best way to get movement to happen.
- I realized the fox didn't have a walking sprite.

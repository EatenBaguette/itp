# Think Python Full Notes
## Chapter 1
### New
A program has these basic features:
- input: get data from keyboard, file, network
- output: display data on screen, save in a file, send over network
- math
- condition
- repetition
- Break down a complex problem until it can be solved by a combo of these steps.
<br/>

- ^ bitwise operator
- natural language: language which evolves naturally overtime
- formal language: language which is created for specific purpose. Usually syntax is more strict than in natural language
- People respond to computers as if they were people. It can be helpful to interact with computers from a manager's perspective to avoid frustration: understanding the computer's strengths of speed and precision and weaknesses of an inability to understand the overall project and a lack of empathy.

### Knew
- Hello World
- Arithmetic Operators
    - + addition
    - - subtraction
    - * multiplication  
    - / division
    - // floor division
    - % remainder
    - ** exponentiation
- integer, floating point, strings

## Chapter 3
### New
- when a function is called, python looks at the definition of the function (most likely in a different location in the code than what is currently running) to see what to do, then picks up where it left off.
### Knew
- math module
- adding new functions
- variable must appear on left, not right
- variables and parameters are local
## Chapter 5
### New
- pass statement does nothing (for if you haven't yet written part of the code, helps save a placeholder)
- Recursion
### Knew
- relational operators
- logical operators
- chained conditionals: the statement ends after the first if or elif that runs, meaning subsequent elif and else do not run within that statement.
- Nested conditionals
## Chapter 10
### New
- I haven't used lists yet while learning python. 
```
for i in range(len(numbers)):
    numbers[i] = numbers[i] * 2
```
This is how to traverse a list and update items in it. This example multiplies each item of the list by 2.
### Knew
- Lists exist in python and they use square brackets to denote them.

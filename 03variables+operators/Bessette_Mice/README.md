# Bessette_Mice

## Problem
* The first line had two tabs. The second line had three. The third had four.
* I needed to use only one print function.
* I needed to input 3 as a value.
## Solution
* Since 3 had to be a value, I used the formatted print by placing f before the apostrophe.
* I used two \t to put two tabs.
* I used {2+1} to make 3 a value, and so that it could be performed within the apostrophes.
* I put \n to make a new line, then three \t for the three tabs.
* I typed Blind
* I put \n to make a new line, then four \t for the four tabs.
* I typed Mice.
